### Major problems
I hope that throughout this project I can gain a better understanding on the ins and out of react, mainly looked to explore- Form(user input- add/delete), router, props, conditional functions and front-end skills.

#### text to speech API research:
- [react-voice-components](https://github.com/grvcoelho/react-voice-components/) - I started with this one
- [react-speech](https://github.com/andrewkeig/react-speech)
- [IBM API](https://cloud.ibm.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest/)
- [web API speech](https://w3c.github.io/speech-api/#implementation-considerations)
