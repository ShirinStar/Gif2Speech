### Major problems
I hope that throughout this project to gain a better understanding on the ins and out of react, mainly looked to explore- Form (user input- add/delete options), router, props, conditional functions, connections between two APIs and front-end skills. 

#### Open questions
- how to type without 'play' at the same time?
- t2s API?
- they can choose to finish before filling all the 'squares'
- how can I find ways to make it more fluid experience?

Delete Button | M | 1.5
Debbuging collisions | H | 3
Design | H | 13

### text to speech API research:
- [react-voice-components](https://github.com/grvcoelho/react-voice-components/) - I started with this one
- [react-speech](https://github.com/andrewkeig/react-speech)
- [IBM API](https://cloud.ibm.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest/)
- [web API speech](https://w3c.github.io/speech-api/#implementation-considerations)
